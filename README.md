## Math 134A preference solution

这份代码集合代表了我在Math 134A课程中的全部学习成果。首先，我想将其作为对这段学习经历的纪念。其次，我想借此机会感谢加州大学欧文分校（UCI）提供给我这次宝贵的交换学习机会，让我深刻体验到美国本科教育的独特魅力。

在美国的教育环境中，我发现老师和助教更愿意投入时间和精力帮助学生在学术上成长，这可能正是高等教育的真正意义所在。尽管这门课程表面上是关于投资学，实际上它更多地涉及Python编程。通过提前准备好的代码，我能够在考试时通过调整部分数字来解决问题。

在此，我特别感谢我的教授Jeff和助教Robbins，他们在我遇到难题时给予了悉心指导。同时，我也要感谢那些在学习过程中给予我帮助的美国本科同学、ChatGPT，以及网络上那些我从未谋面的朋友。正是你们的帮助，使我能够顺利完成这三门课程中最具挑战性的一门。

今天是2023年12月15日，距离我回国的日子仅剩两天。我不确定未来是否会再次来到UCI继续我的研究生学习，但我将永远感激UCI提供给我的这次交流机会。

As the semester ends, you found out that someone was offering to sell answers to practice exams for a price between $100 and $150. This, in your view, is detrimental to the actual purpose of education, especially in a subject as critical as investment studies.

Instead of encouraging a deep understanding of investment concepts, this practice of selling answers tempts students to simply buy their way to good grades. This approach undermines the fundamental goal of education, which is not just to pass exams, but to deeply understand and engage with the subject matter. It's about the journey of learning, questioning, and discovering, not just the destination of a high score.

You've taken a stand against this by deciding to release the material for free. This decision is based on the hope that it will encourage future students to focus on the real value of their education: learning and understanding, not just scoring well. By doing so, you're advocating for a more authentic and meaningful educational experience where knowledge and comprehension are valued over mere exam scores.

Thanks for everyone.
